how are you doing today
people swim in swimming pools
today is a sunny day
sentences are made of words
are you reading a long book
it is freezing cold outside
the oven is burning hot
we use umbrellas in the rain
this is a comfy chair
we wash our hands before touching things
books have many pages
we play tennis at tennis courts
cups are for drinking from
the leaves are falling from the trees
i love to watch the birds fly
i do not like running in the rain
the tree on the path fell over
the glass windows need cleaning
fireflies lit up the night sky
go clean the countertop
